# DevMountain Group Project Rubric

The group project is your opportunity to work as you will in the "real world". You'll learn critical technical skills like git as a group, but also management ones like divvying up tasks and communicating status.

## Projects and Teams
* Students will present project ideas to the cohort. Any student may present, and students do not need to commit to their own idea.
  * If you have a friend in the industry, consider asking them for project ideas. This works especially well when the person went to a bootcamp and/or is familiar with what a junior developer team could accomplish in two weeks.
  * Here's how to present your idea.
    * It should take 1-3 minutes.
    * You do not need to use a computer to give your presentation, although in the past, students who go to this length (showing slides, similar sites, or prototypes) usually get their projects chosen.
    * Come up with a description, that's approx 5 words or less, e.g. "Twitter Clone" or "Group messaging centered around events". You may optionally have a project name (which can be changed later). Students will refer to these descriptions/names when voting.
    * Mention MVP tasks. What's the main idea? Importantly, talk about the things you WOULDN'T do, such that you can focus on what matters.
    * Mention a bulleted list of technologies that you'd use besides the obvious ones like React and Node/Express. Include 3rd-party APIs you'd probably use. E.g. "We'd use Google Maps to show the event locations, Calendly to show calendars, sockets for real-time chat, and Stripe to accept payments. I'd like to try MobX instead of Redux because I think we'd be more productive."
    * Finally, mention how you think this project is good for highlighting your skills to employers.

* Students will vote to express project preference (not team preference).
* The teams are ultimately determined by staff.
* The projects are ultimately approved by staff. Changes/pivots can be accepted but must be approved by staff.
* Each team will be assigned a mentor.

## Requirements

### Technical Requirements
* 2 unit tests per person
* 2 integration tests per person
* End-to-end (aka E2E) tests with Cypress are not required but will probably help your project!

### Project Management Requirements
* 50 Tasks in Trello, before coding
  * Planning is always a critically important part of a project. Breaking down your project into tasks that need to be completed saves an enormous amount of time.
* Blueprint completed with quality sketches and unit test plan
  * Plan out your features, endpoints and schemas, just like you did in your personal project.
  * Create sketches of what your basic site layout will be, on computer or papec. They don't have to be design mock-up quality.
  * Writing a bunch of unit tests when you've finished your project doesn't really benefit you at all. Plan out what parts of your site you can unit test ahead of time.
* Daily Standups
  * Daily standups are a crucial part of the popular "Agile" way of approaching projects.
  * Talk about what you got done the day prior, what you plan on getting done today, and anything you see that will block your path.
  * This should take about 1-3 minutes per team member.
  * Standups are to be done with the group's mentor, so make sure to coordinate.
* Everyone in the group has at least 15 commits
  * It is important that everyone in the group is contributing. A good way to track that is by ensuring everyone in the group has a certain number of commits.
  * Some employers will look at your code, so it's important that it's clear which contributions are yours.

### Social Requirements
* Treat this project like a job
  * You are closer to having a developer job than ever before. As such, you should treat this project like a job. At a job, it is naturally expected of you to show up on time and do your work. At a job, it is expected of you to act civilly and cooperate with your coworkers. There are always social consequences to your actions, whether positive or negative. Your team members are likely to help you get contacts for getting jobs in the future and give you references... or not.
  * If you don't treat this like a job and your teammates complain about your behavior, this could result in you not meeting this requirement.

**Failure to meet these requirements may result in you needing to undergo an alternate badging process**
